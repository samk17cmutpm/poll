# poll
First time
This application is the same as Amazingpoll.com. It's written is nodejs, mongodb, socketio.

If you want to run this application, Please install MongoDB on your computer and create a database name 'poll'. Then just use 
the terminal navigate to the directory of the project and run "node index.js"

this is a video about installing MongoDB "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uFY60CESlM", I hope it will help, thanks
